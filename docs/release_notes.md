## 2.1
### 2.1.0
* The default quote character for delimited files is now the double quote character (") and quoting is enabled by default.
 If you don't want quoting support, you need to actively switch it off. See [Quoted values](basics_schema#quoted-values) in documentation.
* Support for quote syntax RFC4180 which makes both the CSV parser and composer compliant to the RFC 4180 standard regarding quoting.
* Support for enum cell type and mapping between enum values and text representation. See chapter about [enum format](basics_schema#enum-format) in the article [Basics of Schema](basics_schema).
* Support for implied decimal format. See chapter about [implied decimal](basics_schema#implied-decimal) in the article [Basics of Schema](basics_schema).
* The command line utility is now capable of also transforming the output by using a XSLT file.
* Added class **ByLineTypeLineEventListener**. A convenience class that acts as a subscription hub for line parsed events.
* When converting to and from java beans, it is now possible to map schema line types and 
 cell names by using annotations in the target class instead of providing a bean map as an xml. 
* This version of the library requires at least Java 11 to build but the official binaries are still built for Java release 8.
* The following classes has moved to package `org.jsapar.bean` in order to make them visible externally when introducing modules: 
  * org.jsapar.parse.bean.BeanMap
  * org.jsapar.parse.bean.Xml2BeanMapBuilder
* The following classes has moved to package `org.jsapar.text` in order to make them visible externally when introducing modules: 
  * org.jsapar.parse.text.TextParseConfig
* Removed dependency to `java.beans` package since that imposed dependency to `java.desktop` module.
* Introduced schema cell properties that controls whether pad characters and leading spaces should be trimmed or not while parsing.
* For cells where pad character is something other than space, the default behavior is now to trim leading spaces. The behavior from previous version can be 
obtained by setting the schema cell property to not trim leading spaces. See documentation page [Basics of Schema](basics_schema). 
* Added some checks for null values in constructors thus finding errors during initialization instead of while parsing/composing.
* The interfaces LineEventListener and ErrorEventListener are now marked with annotation @FunctionalInterface. 
## 2.0
### 2.0.1
1. Performance improvements while parsing delimited (CSV) sources and fixed width sources where lines are separated. 
Performance of the parsing part should be improved by at least 50% in a normal scenario. Both CPU and memory impact has been significantly improved.
1. Default cell cache size while parsing is now 1 (instead of 10) since this has the best characteristics in a normal scenario. A single item sized cache could be implemented in a lot easier way leading to better performance.  
1. Changed behaviour when parsing quoted delimited sources. When a start quote is found but no end quote within 8kB of data, the parser now
tries again to parse the source but considers that particular cell as not being quoted.
1. It is now possible to configure maximum line length while parsing. Default is 8kB.
1. When using first line as schema while parsing CSV and the header line 
contains an empty cell, the cells of the body at that position will now 
be ignored while reading. Previously this generated an exception and parsing was aborted.
